# tic-tac-toe
A game of Tic Tac Toe


Game project that focuses on html, CSS and Javascript. Diving deeper into JS factory functions, modules and closures. The goal is to create JS functions in a clean and organized manner and minimize global scope variables. This will allow easier editing and gives a single point of focus for each function (each factory function should be doing a single task).
